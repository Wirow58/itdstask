This is a demo application done for ITDS by Bartosz Kowalski as a part of the recruitment process.

Before running this application please make sure you have installed PostgreSQL and created new empty database.
Then change spring.datasource.url spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password properties
to valid ones (in application.properties file or by flags with ./gradlew bootrun command, like:
./gradlew -Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demo bootRun   ).


To run the application first build it with command ./gradlew build and then run it by ./gradlew bootrun
Application exposes a single endpoint under GET /users/{login} path which returns data of the user with given login
from api.github.com domain alongside with proper calculations. If the user does not exist endpoint will return
404 status with a appropriate message. If the calculation cannot be done (for example when the number of followers is 0)
NaN value will be returned. For every successful request counter will be increased by one in user_request_counts table
in a row corresponding to the given login. If given login will appear for the first time in the system and
the application would receive valid data the new row will be created for that login.
