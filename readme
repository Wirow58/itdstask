This is a demo application done for ITDS by Bartosz Kowalski as a part of the recruitment process.

Before running this application please make sure you have installed postgresql and created new empty database
and then change spring.datasource.url spring.datasource.username and spring.datasource.password properties
to valid ones (in application.properties file or by flags with ./gradlew bootrun command).

To run the application first build it with command ./gradlew build and then run it by ./gradlew bootrun
Application exposes single endpoint under GET /users/{login} path which returns data of user with given login
from api.github.com domain alongside with proper calculations. If the user does not exist endpoint will return
404 status with appropriate message. If the calculation cannot be done (for example when the number of followers is 0)
NaN value will be returned.
